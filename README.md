# Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This repository contains my Personal Bio page. We were assigned the task of creating a simple, responsive portfolio website using Bootstrap Grid capabilities.

I felt somewhat indecisive when beginning this project, but ended up going with a two-color theme. I began just with a navbar. I have yet to find a fix for the collapsed list on small screens. Hopefully, I can re-submit in the next couple of days. The design of the page was modeled after mobile app appearances, so this was disappointing.

Most of my time was spent making the the content look presentable on a laptop screen. This served me well, for the most part, as I was eventually able to pare down the size at the end of the project in one fell swoop.

The index page has 4 rows: Navigation, Bio/Article, External/Social Media Links, Footer. Text wrap is not executed. this was another shortcoming. I am happy with the buttons as social media links.

The contact page was relatively simple. Inserted a form from bootstrap. This was a matter of setting up rows and columns and d-flex properties.

Portfolio page was challenging, but the I managed to make the images responsive.

I added an external stylesheet for a consistent style across each page but relied more heavily on bootstrap for page structure an colors.
