# Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This repository contains my Personal Bio page. We were assigned the task of creating a simple, responsive portfolio website using Bootstrap Grid capabilities.

The Index or Home Page contains my revised bio in a Bootstrap carousel. Each contained jumbotron will contain background photos in the future.
